Overview</h1>
<p>All current hardware platforms, from desktops to tablets and smartphones, are built around multicore and heterogeneous systems on a chip (SoC). MARE addresses the question of how to enable full utilization of the hardware at the user application level, in the following way: </p>
<ul>
<li>By providing a concurrent programming model that allows developers to express the concurrency in their applications. MARE's powerful abstractions ease the burden of parallel programming since it was designed with dynamic concurrency from the ground up. </li>
<li>By embedding the programming model in C++ and providing a C++ library API. C++ is a familiar language for a large number of performance oriented developers, thus making it easy for programmers to pick up the abstractions quickly. C++ embedding also allows incremental development of existing applications, since MARE interoperates with existing libraries, such as pthreads and OpenGL.</li>
</ul>
<p>MARE runs on top of a runtime system that will execute the concurrent applications on all the available computational resources on the SoC. Our current implementation is focused on multicore with future releases supporting heterogeneous SoCs.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="writing"></a>
Writing a MARE Application</h2>
<p>The fundamental abstraction in MARE is a task &ndash; an independent unit of work that can execute concurrently with other tasks. To build a MARE application, the programmers express the computation as a partially ordered task graph. The nodes in the graph are tasks, and the edges are dependencies. The directed acyclic graph (DAG) is scheduled by the runtime system based on resource availability as dependencies are satisfied. The reason this makes it easier to write parallel applications than using thread libraries is because the expression of concurrency is decoupled from the hardware thread abstraction. This has two advantages: first, programs are portable between different multicore platforms, since the application does not rely on a predefined number of cores or threads; second, tasks are light-weight, and therefore allow the expression of finer-grained concurrency, thus giving programmers the ability to parallelize a much larger set of algorithms and applications. In addition, MARE provides a set of attributes (annotations on tasks) that allow programmers to provide additional information about the semantics of the application, thus giving the runtime system more insights into the application behavior. This allows the runtime system to make better scheduling decisions, increasing the efficiency of the parallel application.</p>
<p>Figure below illustrates how to write an application using MARE:</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="fig_MAREWorkflow"></a><br/>
</p>
 <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="MARE_workflow_HTML.png" alt="MARE workflow" width="60%" height="60%"><br/><br/><b>MARE workflow</b></div><br/> <p>The workflow from start to completion of a MARE application is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the algorithm to be parallelized and design a parallel version of the algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Encode the algorithm using MARE abstractions. This includes partitioning the algorithm into tasks and partitioning the data for concurrent access.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Building the DAG by setting up dependencies between tasks. MARE decouples the task creation from the task launch to allow dynamically building the DAG.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The programmer has now developed a skeleton of the parallel algorithm and should implement each task. MARE is based on a shared memory programming paradigm. As tasks access memory, the programmer must protect shared data accesses with appropriate synchronization primitives (locks or atomic operations).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The MARE application consists of a forest of DAGs. The runtime system schedules the tasks once their dependencies are satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are a number of housekeeping functions provided in the MARE API that allow an application programmer to manage the runtime and the concurrency of the application. These are explained in later sections of the manual.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="executing"></a>
Executing a MARE Application</h2>
<p>The MARE runtime fundamentally implements a thread pool over which tasks are scheduled at the user level. When the application starts running, the thread pool is initialized such that it makes optimal use of the existing hardware contexts on the device. The scheduler is a throughput-oriented scheduler. Tasks are scheduled in a non-preemptive manner as they are ready for execution (dependencies are satisfied). The task attributes mechanism in MARE allows developers to provide additional application information, which enables the runtime system to make better decisions and schedule tasks on the appropriate resources.</p>
<p>The figure below illustrates how the MARE runtime executes MARE applications.</p>

<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>This section explains how to configure an application to use MARE given the binary distribution. The installer package available from the <a href="http://developer.qualcomm.com/mare">Qualcomm Developer Network</a> contains precompiled libraries for Android, GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS X. Please install the distribution on your system following the installer prompts, and then see the appropriate section below on how to use it on your particular platform.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="buildExamples"></a>
Verifying your installation</h1>
<p>By default, the binary installer places the MARE library, headers, and examples in the following directory: <code>$HOME/Qualcomm/MARE/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;platform&gt;/&lt;build_type&gt;</code>. We call this directory MARE_DIR in the rest of the document. Substitute <em>platform</em> with the name of the directory for native architecture on which you installed MARE, e.g., for Linux, x86_64-linux-gnu. Substitute <em>build_type</em> with the desired type, e.g., <em>debug</em> or <em>release</em>. Additional information on platforms and build types is discussed for each supported architecture below. You may choose to install in a different location, in which case, that location becomes MARE_DIR.</p>
<p>To verify the installation, please do the following:</p>
<p>Android: </p>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd><pre class="fragment">cd $MARE_DIR/examples
$ANDROID_NDK/ndk-build
$ANDROID_SDK/adb shell mkdir /data/mare
$ANDROID_SDK/adb push bin/helloworld1 /data/mare
$ANDROID_SDK/adb shell /data/mare/helloworld1
</pre></dd></dl>
<p>Linux or Mac OS X: </p>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd><pre class="fragment">cd $MARE_DIR/examples
cmake .
make
./helloworld1
</pre></dd></dl>
<p>On Windows 32bit: </p>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd><pre class="fragment">cd %MARE_DIR%/examples
cmake . -G "Visual Studio 12"
cmake --build . --config &lt;Release|Debug&gt; -- /m
helloworld1.exe
</pre> On Windows 64bit, use the generator for cmake to be "Visual Studio 12 Win64".</dd></dl>
<p>The output of this program should be: </p>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd><pre class="fragment">examples&gt; ./helloworld1
Hello World!
examples&gt;
</pre></dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="androidmk"></a>
Integrating MARE with Android NDK Applications</h1>
<p>The precompiled MARE libraries can be easily integrated with an existing native Android application. These libraries have been compiled with the Google NDK r9d that includes GCC 4.8. We recommend using the same NDK and compiler.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Requirements</dt><dd>You must have a working Google NDK r9 or later installed on your system. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>You will need to make changes to your project files to use the MARE libraries. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>For Heterogeneous Compute support (e.g., GPU offload), please refer to section <a class="el" href="binaries.html#section_requirements_heterogeneous_compute">Heterogeneous Compute</a>.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Modify Application.mk</dt><dd>Edit your project's Application.mk file to include the following entries: <pre class="fragment">APP_STL := gnustl_static
APP_ABI := armeabi-v7a
NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION := 4.8
#set the APP_PLATFORM to match your platform version.
#APP_PLATFORM := android-19
LOCAL_ARM_NEON := true
</pre> GCC 4.8.x is necessary to link against the precompiled library. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>gnustl_static must be used to provide the necessary C++11 library support which is not available in other APP_STL configurations.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Modify Android.mk</dt><dd>Edit your project's Android.mk to define the location of the MARE libraries and headers, MARE_DIR. For Android, MARE_DIR may be an absolute path, or a path relative to your current project. Include the MARE.mk at that location file as follows: <pre class="fragment">MARE_DIR := $(HOME)/Qualcomm/MARE/0.11.0/arm-linux-androideabi/&lt;build_type&gt;
include ${MARE_DIR}/lib/MARE.mk
</pre> </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Substitute build_type with one of the following provided build types: release, debug, release-gpu, debug-gpu, and release-ftrace-logging. Substituting ${APP_OPTIM} instead will automatically choose between release and debug builds.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Edit your project's Android.mk file for each build target to include the following: <pre class="fragment">LOCAL_ARM_MODE := arm
LOCAL_CPP_FEATURES := rtti exceptions
LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES := libmare
</pre> Note that unlike other platforms, $(MARE_CXX_FLAGS) are automatically picked by the android ndk build system from MARE.mk, so it need not be set explicitly.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd></dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Build using ndk-build</dt><dd>To build your application using the ndk-build run: <pre class="fragment">$ANDROID_NDK/ndk-build
</pre></dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Shared libraries</dt><dd>In most cases, linking statically with libmare will be the easiest approach. For applications with large numbers of libraries, you must link dynamically so that only one copy of MARE exists in memory. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>To use MARE as a shared library, you will need to ensure that you include libmare_shared.so into your APK file, and load it using loadLibrary("mare_shared") from Java before loading any other libraries. Next, you need to change LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES to <pre class="fragment">LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES := libmare_shared
</pre> </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>and add the following to the end of your Android.mk:</dt><dd><pre class="fragment">include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE := libmare_shared
LOCAL_LDFLAGS := -llog
LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES := libmare
include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)
</pre> </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>You will also need to update APP_STL in Application.mk to use gnustl_shared, so that both your application and all the libraries use dynamic linking. You may experience strange crashes if you mix static and dynamic linking.</dd></dl>
<p>If you are using the GPU version, please see <a class="el" href="binaries.html#section_requirements_heterogeneous_compute">Heterogeneous Compute</a> for additional requirements.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="unix"></a>
GNU/Linux and Mac OS X</h1>
<p>MARE can also be compiled on most GNU/Linux and Mac OS X systems. This is useful if you have a portable application that you want to test on a standard PC before running it on an Android device.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Requirements</dt><dd>MARE requires GCC 4.7.1 or later or clang 4.2 (LLVM 3.2) or later, which provide the necessary C++11 functionality. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>The recommended MARE development environment is an Ubuntu Linux 12.04 LTS or later system. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>If you are starting with a basic Ubuntu system, the necessary compilers and build tools may not be installed by default (the versions for 12.04LTS are not). In this case, you need to install the required versions manually using apt-get.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Please refer to section <a class="el" href="binaries.html#section_requirements_heterogeneous_compute">Heterogeneous Compute</a> for requirements on heterogeneous compute.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Using MARE in your application</dt><dd>The binary distribution includes a <a href="http://www.cmake.org">cmake</a> configuration option that allows you to configure your application to use MARE using the find_package command. Edit your application's CMakeLists.txt to include the following fragment: <pre class="fragment">find_package(MARE PATHS ${MARE_DIR}/lib/CMake/mare} NO_DEFAULT_PATH)

if(NOT MARE_FOUND)
  message(FATAL_ERROR "MARE not found")
endif()

include_directories(${MARE_INCLUDE_DIRS})
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "$CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${MARE_CXX_FLAGS}")
add_executable(your_application ${your_application_SRCS})
target_link_libraries(your_application ${MARE_LIBRARIES})
</pre></dd></dl>
<p>Then configure your application using: </p>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd><pre class="fragment">cmake . -DMARE_DIR=${HOME}/Qualcomm/MARE/0.11.0/&lt;platform&gt;/&lt;build_type&gt;
</pre> </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Substitute platform with one of: x86_64-apple-darwin or x86_64-linux-gnu. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Substitute build_type with one of the following provided build types: release, debug, release-gpu, or debug-gpu.</dd></dl>
<p>If your application is using a different build system, please look at the definitions in <code>$MARE_DIR/lib/CMake/lib/MAREConfig.cmake</code>, and: </p>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Add to your C++ compiler flags the flags listed in ${MARE_CXX_FLAGS}. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Add to your C++ include files the directories listed in ${MARE_INCLUDE_DIRS}. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Add to your libraries flags, the libraries listed in ${MARE_LIBRARIES}.</dd></dl>
<p>Note that the MARE API changes based on the definitions listed in ${MARE_CXX_FLAGS}, including with -DNDEBUG. MARE includes a link time check that verifies that the correct flags were used for the application and the included library. Should you not use the correct flags, you will receive a link error, similar to: </p>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd><pre class="fragment">mare::runtime::__mare_with_api_no_apid_int_debug_init_count", referenced from:
      mare::runtime::init()    in your_application.o

</pre></dd></dl>
<p>Please check your flags before raising an issue.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Additional requirement for using Heterogeneous Compute API</dt><dd>OpenCL 1.2 or later has to be installed. (see section <a class="el" href="binaries.html#section_requirements_heterogeneous_compute">Heterogeneous Compute</a>).</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Mac OS X specific notes</dt><dd>Currently, clang is the only compiler included with Xcode that supports C++11 and can compile MARE. When using -std=c++11, you should also use -stdlib=libc++ to include the proper library support.</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="msvc"></a>
Microsoft Windows</h1>
<p>The MARE binaries have been compiled for Microsoft Visual Studio 2013. This is useful to develop for Microsoft Windows, and in particular, developing a portable concurrent application that can be easily targeted to Android as well.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Requirements</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>MARE requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2013. We make extensive use of C++11, and this is not supported properly in previous versions of Microsoft Visual Studio. MARE is supported only for 32-bit and 64-bit Intel platforms on Microsoft Visual Studio. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>The <a class="el" href="group__chapter__heterogeneous__compute__doc.html">Heterogeneous Compute API</a> is not supported on Windows.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Adding MARE to your application</dt><dd>Precompiled libraries have been provided for debug and release builds, on both Win32 and x64 architectures. Your project will need some changes to support compiling with the MARE headers and libraries. If you are using cmake, please see the instructions for Linux and Mac OS X. Otherwise, make sure that your solution is compatible with VS2013, and right-click on your project and go to the properties editor. Make the following changes in the "Configuration Properties" section: </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd><em>C/C++ - General - Additional Include Directives</em> </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Add the following include paths to the end of your current include list, and replace %(MARE_DIR) to point to the location of your MARE distribution relative to the current project file: <pre class="fragment">;%(MARE_DIR)\include
</pre> </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd><em>C/C++ - Preprocessor - Preprocessor Definitions</em> </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Add the following #define if you are working with a Release build: <pre class="fragment">;NDEBUG
</pre> </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Add the following #define for a Debug build: <pre class="fragment">;MARE_ENABLE_CHECK_API_DETAILED
</pre> If you do not do this correctly, you will see errors involving an unresolved symbol "__mare_with_debug__taskqueue" or "__mare_with_ndebug__taskqueue". This is designed to protect you against incorrectly linking debug and non-debug libraries. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd><em>C/C++ - Code Generation - Runtime Library</em> </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Change to use "Multi-threaded (/MT)" in Release mode, or "Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd)" in Debug mode, which is what MARE is compiled with. This needs to be consistent across the solution. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd><em>Linker - Input - Additional Dependencies</em> </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Add the following libraries to the end of your current library list: <pre class="fragment">;%(MARE_DIR)/lib/libmare.lib

<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Substitute <em>platform</em> with one of: i386-windows or x86_64-windows. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Substutute <em>build_type</em> with one of: release or debug.</dd></dl>
<p>If you do not do this correctly, you will see errors involving an unresolved symbol "__mare_with_debug__taskqueue" or "__mare_with_ndebug__taskqueue". This is designed to protect you against incorrectly linking debug and non-debug libraries. </p>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd><em>Linker - All Options - Image Has Safe Exception Handlers</em> </dd></dl>

<dl class="section user"><dt>Building</dt><dd>At this point, you should be able to build the entire solution, and your executable is now enabled for use with MARE. You need to initialize the runtime during the startup of your application, and then you can create and launch MARE tasks.</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="section_requirements_heterogeneous_compute"></a>
Heterogeneous Compute</h1>
<p>MARE Heterogeneous Compute (e.g., GPU offload) is currently supported through OpenCL. OpenCL 1.2 or later is required on your platform. An example of a Qualcomm-based platform that meets this requirement is the <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/mobile-development/development-devices/dragonboard">DragonBoard APQ8074</a>.</p>
<p>For using MARE's Heterogeneous Compute APIs, please refer to section <a class="el" href="group__chapter__heterogeneous__compute__doc.html">Heterogeneous Compute API</a>.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>OpenCL C++ Support</dt><dd>Using MARE with OpenCL as GPU backend requires presence of the OpenCL C++ header file from Khronos (version must match to your OpenCL driver installation):<br/>
 <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/">http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/</a> <br/>
 The header file should be installed in a subdirectory ${includedir}/OpenCL/ that is searched by the compiler (e.g., /usr/local/include). Alternatively, additional options would need to be passed as compilation flags (e.g., -I${includedir}). </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Unfortunately, the Khronos distributed header file requires small modifications to work on some platforms (see below). In these cases, a patch has to be applied (typically with <code>patch -p1</code>). To that end, the MARE binary distribution contains a patch file <code>$MARE_DIR/lib/CMake/mare/patches/opencl-headers.patch</code>.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Android</dt><dd>Using MARE with OpenCL as GPU backend requires the above mentioned OpenCL C++ header file, which has to be patched per above instructions. In your Android.mk file, please set the ANDROID_CL_DIR variable, <b>before</b> including MARE.mk, as follows: <pre class="fragment">ANDROID_CL_DIR := &lt;path to directory containing include(with patched cl.hpp) and lib folder containing libOpenCL.so&gt;
</pre> ANDROID_CL_DIR/include will be used as include path. ANDROID_CL_DIR/lib will be used as lib path.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Linux</dt><dd>On Linux, OpenCL is generally well-supported, OpenCL header files (including OpenCL C++ headers) are packaged by various Linux distributions (e.g., <code>opencl-headers</code> on Ubuntu/Debian). </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Currently, NVIDIA OpenCL drivers on Linux do not support OpenCL 1.2. They can be used to some degree for testing, provided the above mentioned patch has been applied to the OpenCL C++ header file. The patch prevents linker errors related to <code>clRetainDevice</code> and <code>clReleaseDevice</code>, but consequently also leaks memory when using OpenCL devices. </dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>As further consequence, AMD OpenCL drivers, which would work fine with OpenCL 1.2 out of the box, will also have to be used against the patched OpenCL C++ header files, and consequently they will also leak memory when accessing OpenCL devices.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Mac OS X</dt><dd>On Mac OS X, the OpenCL framework is pre-installed. However, the OpenCL C++ headers will have to be installed (no patching necessary).</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Microsoft Windows</dt><dd>MARE does not currently offer GPU support on Windows. Please contact the MARE developers for inquiries about future support. </dd></dl>

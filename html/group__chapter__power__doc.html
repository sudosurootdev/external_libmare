<p>The MARE power management API provides programmers with a high-level interface to express desired power settings.</p>
<p>The MARE power API provides two operational modes, static and dynamic.</p>
<p>In static mode the programmer picks a predefined operational mode without any intervention from the MARE runtime.</p>
<p>In dynamic mode, the runtime will regulate the cores and frequencies according to a metric provided by the programmer. This mode requires that the program has a repetitive work pattern with a main loop. The code should include a call to set_goal and end_regulation at the prologue and epilogue of the loop and one call to regulate at the end of the body. The regulation has been tunned to provide a performance close to the maximum with energy savings. The programmer should pick a value in the metric close to the maximum possible.</p>
<p>Modes are exclusive. If an application starts an static mode and then switches to dynamic, the static mode request is automatically cancelled.</p>
<p>All API methods provide hints to the system and do not guarantee that the device state will be the requested state. Depending on the rest of the running applications, temperature, and other factors the number of cores and frequencies may differ from those requested.</p>
<p>Using the power management API requires including the following header file: </p>
<pre class="fragment">   #include &lt;mare/powermanager.hh&gt;</pre><p>Support for this API is only included on some Qualcomm devices. For other devices, the methods do not perform any operation.

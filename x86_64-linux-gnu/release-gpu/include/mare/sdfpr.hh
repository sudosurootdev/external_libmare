/**
  Introspection data-structure used by the programmatic body of an SDF node.

  In addition to using <tt>body(T1& t1, T2& t2, ..., Tn& tn)</tt>, where
  the type signature is fixed at compile-time and a priori fixes the
  data-types, direction and number of channels connecting to that body's
  SDF node, MARE SDF allows a programmatic introspection body with the
  following type signature that can discover the nature of channels
  connected to it:<BR>
     <tt>body(node_channels& ncs)</tt>

  Inside the body, the user-code can use the <tt>ncs</tt> object to query the
  number of channels connected, and for each channel query its direction
  (in or out) and the element-size carried by it. While node_channels
  provides the user the flexibility to attach however many channels of
  whatever user-data-types to a node, type-safety is reduced as there is no
  longer compile-time type matching between the type signature of
  <tt>body</tt> and the types and number of channels attached to the node.

  read() and write() methods inside node_channels allow the user-code to
  access data popped from in-channels and provide data to push to out-channels.
  The user-code must pass program variables by reference, whose sizes must
  match the element-sizes of the corresponding channels. read() and write()
  provide some runtime safety by checking that the size of the passed program
  variable matches the element-size of the channel.

  Runtime error if a write is attempted on an in-channel
  or if a read is attempted on an out-channel.

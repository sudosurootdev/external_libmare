  /// An SDF Partition executes a topologically sorted subset of the SDF graph
  /// nodes.
  /// A partition needs a "resume" point to start execution of its nodes, and
  /// an "end" point (possibly infinity). The execution must stop just *before*
  /// the end point, but start at the resume point. Further, if the execution
  /// of a partition is interrupted by a signal from the SDF launcher, the
  /// SDF launcher needs to determine a new resume point for the partition, so
  /// that the combined execution prior to and subsequent to the interruption
  /// appears "seamless". Therefore, the end point of an interrupted execution
  /// is defined as the next resume point when (if) the execution is re-tried
  /// by the SDF launcher.
  ///
  /// struct partition_iteration: representation of the resume point.
  ///
  /// Information requirements for partition_iteration:

  /// - Execution can be interrupted in the middle of a graph iteration. Hence,
  /// the next node to execute is noted in the resume information.
  ///
  /// - Further, a node may only "partially" execute if a blocked channel is
  /// encountered or the SDF launcher's interruption signal is detected in
  /// between a node's pop channels, apply node-function, and push channels
  /// stages. Hence, a flag must also indicate if a node was interrupted so
  /// that the node gets re-tried when execution is resumed. The node
  /// execution logic (see sdf_node_typed::iter_work() in
  /// sdfapiimplementation.hh), internally keeps track of how far the node
  /// executed, so the resume point does not need to hold those details.
  ///
  /// The partition_iteration consists of the following fields to accommodate
  /// the resume information requirements discussed above.
  ///  - _iter      : the overall graph iteration
  ///
  ///  - _node_index: which node to resume execution at within _iter

  ///  - _before_first_iter: a special case to indicate that execution has
  ///         not even been attempted. Distinct from (_iter=0, _node_index=0).
  ///         Semantics: (_before_first_iter=true) < (_iter=0, _node_index=0),
  ///                    where "<" means "strictly earlier in execution order".
  ///
  ///  - _node_interrupted: flags that _node_index was partially executed,
  ///                       hence needs to be re-tried when excecution resumes.
  ///         Semantics: (_iter=x, _node_index=y, _node_interrupted=false) <
  ///                    (_iter=x, _node_index=y, _node_interrupted=true),
  ///                    as the latter has partially executed node y, while
  ///                    the former is about to begin execution of y.
  ///
  ///  The captured resume information allows the SDF launcher to compare the
  ///  progress of multiple partitions, and determine which partition is the
  ///  most ahead and which is the most behind (using comparison operators
  /// defined on partition_iteration). This information helps the SDF launcher
  /// to make determinations about the "consistency" of an interruption across
  ///  partitions, and selectively execute any lagging partitions to an
  ///  acceptable "synchronization point" consistent with the desired
  ///  interruption semantics.

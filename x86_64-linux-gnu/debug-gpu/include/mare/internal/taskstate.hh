/// Records the state of a task
///
/// UNLAUNCHED: Task in UNLAUNCHED state cannot execute, even if they have
///             no predecessors.
///
/// READY: Tasks in READY state are ready to execute as soon as the number of
///        predecessors is 0.
///
/// RUNNING: Task state once MARE's scheduler starts executing a
///          task. If a task is in this state, it doesn't mean that it
///          is actually running on a device.  For example, a task
///          state can be RUNNING but the task might be blocked
///          waiting for another task to complete.
///
/// COMPLETED: Task state after it successfully finishes execution.
///
/// CANCELED: A task t will eventually transition to CANCELED if:
///            - t->cancel() was called before the task started running.
///            - t->cancel() was called while the task was running and
///              the task acknowledges that it saw the cancelation.
///            - The task throws an exception during execution and
///               the programmer didn't catch it.
///
/// The following diagram depicts the all the possible state transitions
/// for a task. Notice that there are no back arrows.
///
///
///
/// UNLAUNCHED--> READY --> RUNNING ~~> COMPLETED
///                  |
///                   ~~~~> CANCELED
///
/// Transitions depicted by ~~> grab the task' lock.
///
/// State are represented with an uint_fast8_t type. Their value
/// is important because sometimes we check that the state is
/// <= that RUNNING.

  Base class representing a channel connection between two SDF nodes.

  Cannot be instantiated directly by user. User code must instantiate the
  derived class <tt>data_channel<T></tt> to create a channel carrying elements
  of user-defined-type <tt>T</tt>.

  However, user code can pass pointers of the base type <tt>channel*</tt>
  and use those to connect SDF nodes instead of the templated
  <tt>data_channel<T></tt>. This is useful for the programmatic construction
  of an SDF graph, where the number and user-data-types of channels connected
  to a node may not be fixed at compile-time: specialized user code may create
  typed data_channels, while generic user code may only use <tt>channel*</tt>
  to connect the graph.

/**
  Adds delay initializer elements to a channel.

  Edges in a synchronous dataflow graph can have delays associated with them.
  Any cycle in the graph must have at least one delay on at least one of the
  edges constituting the cycle in order to be a valid synchronous dataflow
  graph. In general, additional delays in a cycle or delays on purely
  feed-forward paths alter the semantics of the graph.

  With MARE SDF, edges are implemented as channels. A delay of 'N'
  is associated with a channel by adding N initializer elements to the
  channel using preload_channel().

  @param dc
  A <tt>data_channel<T></tt> of user-defined-type <tt>T</tt>.

  @param tr
  A container of N elements of data-type <tt>T</tt>, where N is the
  desired number of delays to add to the channel. N must be > 0.
  The container can be any data-structure supporting range-based
  iteration.

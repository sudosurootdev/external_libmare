    Returns a pointer to a group that represents the intersection of
    two groups.

    Some applications require that tasks join more than one group. It
    is possible -- though not recommended for performance
    reasons -- to use mare::launch(group_ptr const&, task_ptr const&)
    or mare::join_group(group_ptr const&, task_ptr const&) repeatedly
    to add a task to several groups. Instead, use
    mare::intersect(group_ptr const&, group_ptr const&) to create a
    new group that represents the intersection of all the groups where
    the tasks need to launch. Again, this method is more performant
    than repeatedly launching the same task into different groups.

    Launching a task into the intersection group also
    simultaneously launches it into all the groups that are part of the
    intersection.

      @note1 Intersection groups do not count towards the 31 maximum
      number of simultaneous groups in the application. Remember that
      group intersection is a somewhat expensive operation. If you
      need to intersect the same groups repeatedly, intersect once,
      and keep the pointer to the group intersection.

    Consecutive calls to <tt>mare::intersect</tt> with the same groups'
    pointer as arguments, return a pointer to the same group. Group
    intersection is a commutative operation.

    You can use the <tt>&</tt> operator instead of
    <tt>mare::intersect</tt>.

    @param a Pointer to the first group.
    @param b Pointer to the second group.

    @return
    group_ptr -- Points to a group that represents the intersection
    of <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>.

    @par Example
    @includelineno group_intersection1.cc
    @par
    The previous code snippet shows an application with two
    groups, <tt>g1</tt> and <tt>g2</tt>, each with 100 and 200 tasks,
    respectively. In line 16, we intersect <tt>g1</tt> and <tt>g2</tt> into
    <tt>g12</tt>. The returned pointer, <tt>g12</tt>, points to an empty
    group because no task yet belongs to both <tt>g1</tt> and <tt>g2</tt>.
    Therefore, <tt>mare::wait_for(g12)</tt> in line 19 returns
    immediately. The <tt>wait_for</tt> calls in lines 22 and 23
    return only once their tasks complete. In line 30, we launch <tt>t</tt>
    into <tt>g12</tt>. The <tt>wait_for</tt> calls in lines 31 and 32
    return only after <tt>t</tt> completes execution because <tt>t</tt> belongs
    to both <tt>t1</tt> and <tt>t2</tt> (and, of course, <tt>g12</tt>).

/**
    Adds a task to group without launching it.

    The recommended way to add a task to a group is by using
    mare::launch(). mare::join_group(group_ptr const& group, task_ptr
    const& task) allows you to add a task into a group without having
    to launch it. Use mare::join_group(group_ptr const& group,
    task_ptr const& task) only when you absolutely need the task
    to belong to a group, but you are not yet ready to launch the task.
    For example, perhaps you want to prevent the group from being empty, so
    you can wait on it somewhere else. This method is slow, and should
    be employed infrequently. It is possible -- though not recommended
    for performance reasons -- to use
    mare::join_group(group_ptr const&, task_ptr const&) repeatedly to
    add a task to several groups. Repeatedly adding a task to the
    same group is not an error.

    Regardless of the method you use to add tasks to a group, the
    following rules always apply:

    - Tasks stay in the group until they complete execution. Once a
      task is added to a group, there is no way to remove it from the
      group.

    - Once a task belonging to multiple groups completes execution,
      MARE removes it from all the groups to which it belongs.

    - Neither completed nor canceled tasks can join groups.

    - Tasks cannot be added to a canceled group.

    @param group Pointer to target group.
    @param task  Pointer to task to add to group.

    @throws api_exception If either <tt>group</tt> or <tt>task</tt> points

    those new tasks also complete.  If

/**
    Cancels all tasks in a group.

    Canceling a group means that:

    - The group tasks that have not started execution will never execute.

    - The group tasks that are executing will be canceled only when they
      call <tt>mare::abort_on_cancel</tt>. If any of these executing tasks
      is a blocking task, MARE executes its cancel handler if
      they had not executed it before.

    - Any tasks added to the group after the group is canceled are also
      canceled.

    Once a group is canceled, it cannot revert to a non-canceled
    state.  mare::cancel(group_ptr const&) returns immediately. Call
    mare::wait_for(group_ptr const&) afterwards to wait for all the
    running tasks to be completed and for all the non-running tasks
    to be canceled.

    @param group Group to cancel.

    @par Example 1
    @includelineno snippets/cancel_group1.cc

    In the example above, we launch 10000 tasks and then sleep for
    some time, so that a few of those 10000 tasks are done, a few
    others are executing, and the majority is waiting to be
    executed. In line 24, we cancel the group, which means that next
    time the running tasks execute <tt>mare::abort_on_cancel()</tt>,
    they will see that their group has been canceled and will
    abort. <tt>wait_for(g)</tt> will not return before the running
    tasks end their execution -- either because they call
    <tt>mare::abort_on_cancel()</tt>, or because they finish writing
    all the messages.

    This method does not return until the task completes its
    execution.  It returns immediately if the task has already
    finished.  If <tt>wait_for(mare::task_ptr)</tt> is called from
    within a task, MARE context-switches the task and finds another
    one to run. If called from outside a task (i.e., the main thread),

    returns.

    where the following property holds:

/**
    Cancels task.

    Use <tt>mare::cancel()</tt> to cancel a task and its
    successors. The effects of <tt>mare::cancel()</tt> depend on the
    task status:

    - If a task is canceled before it launches, it never executes
    -- even if it is launched afterwards. In addition, it propagates
    the cancelation to the task's successors. This is called
    "cancelation propagation".

    - If a task is canceled after it is launched, but before it starts
    executing, it will never execute and it will propagate cancelation
    to its successors.

    - If the task is running when someone else calls
    <tt>mare::cancel()</tt>, it is up to the task to ignore the
    cancelation request and continue its execution, or to honor the
    request via <tt>mare::abort_on_cancel()</tt>, which aborts the
    task's execution and propagates the cancelation to the task's
    successors.

    - Finally, if a task is canceled after it completes its
    execution (successfully or not), it does not change its status and
    it does not propagate cancelation.

    @param task Task to cancel.

    @throws api_exception If task pointer is NULL.

    @par Example 1: Canceling a task before launching it:
    @includelineno cancel_task1.cc

    In the example above, we create two tasks <tt>t1</tt> and
    <tt>t2</tt> and create a dependency between them. Notice that, if
    any of the tasks executes, it will raise an assertion. In line 13,
    we cancel <tt>t1</tt>, which causes <tt>t2</tt> to be canceled as
    well. In line 16, we launch <tt>t2</tt>, but it does not matter as
    it will not execute because it was canceled when <tt>t1</tt>
    propagated its cancelation.

    @par Example 2: Canceling a task after launching it, but before it
    executes.
    @includelineno cancel_task2.cc

    In the example above, we create and chain three tasks <tt>t1</tt>,
    <tt>t2</tt>, and <tt>t3</tt>. In line 18, we launch <tt>t2</tt>,
    but it cannot execute because its predecessor has not executed
    yet. In line 21, we cancel <tt>t2</tt>, which means that it will
    never execute. Because <tt>t3</tt> is <tt>t2</tt>'s successor, it
    is also canceled -- if <tt>t3</tt> had a successor, it would also
    be canceled.

    @par Example 3: Canceling a task while it executes.
    @includelineno abort_on_cancel1.cc

    In the example above, task <tt>t</tt>'s will never finish unless
    it is canceled. <tt>t</tt> is launched in line 12. After
    launching the task, we block for 2 seconds in line 15 to ensure
    that <tt>t</tt> is scheduled and prints its messages. In line 18,
    we ask MARE to cancel the task, which should be running by now.
    <tt>mare::cancel()</tt> returns immediately after it marks the
    task as "pending for cancelation". This means that <tt>t</tt>
    might still be executing after <tt>mare::cancel(t)</tt> returns.
    That is why we call <tt>mare::wait_for(t)</tt> in line
    21, to ensure that we wait for <tt>t</tt> to complete its
    execution.  Remember: a task does not know whether someone has
    requested its cancelation unless it calls
    <tt>mare::abort_on_cancel()</tt> during its execution.

    @par Example 4: Canceling a completed task.
    @includelineno cancel_finished_task1.cc

    In the example above, we launch <tt>t1</tt> and <tt>t2</tt> after
    we set up a dependency between them. On line 25, we cancel
    <tt>t1</tt> after it has completed.  By then, <tt>t1</tt> has
    finished execution (we wait for it in line 21) so
    <tt>cancel(t1)</tt> has no effect. Thus, nobody cancels
    <tt>t2</tt> and <tt>wait_for(t2)</tt> in line 28 never returns.

    Aborts execution of calling task if any of its groups is

    MARE uses cooperative multitasking. Therefore, it cannot abort an
    executing task without help from the task. In MARE, each executing
    task is responsible for periodically checking whether it should
    abort. Thus, tasks call mare::abort_on_cancel() to test whether
    they, or any of the groups to which they belong, have been
    canceled.  If true, mare::abort_on_cancel() does not
    return. Instead, it thows mare::abort_task_exception, which the
    MARE runtime catches. The runtime then transitions the task to a
    canceled state and propagates cancelation to the task's
    successors, if any.

    Because mare::abort_on_cancel() never returns, we recommend that
    you use use RAII to allocate and deallocate the resources used
    inside a task. If using RAII in your code is not an option,

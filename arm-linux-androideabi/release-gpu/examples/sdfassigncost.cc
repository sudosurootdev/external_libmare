// Assignment of Relative Costs to graph nodes
//
// This version of MARE statically partitions the graph nodes across the
// available CPU cores. To achieve high performance and high utilization
// of the cores, the partitions need to be balanced. That is, the cumulative
// execution times of nodes within each partition should roughly be the
// same across partitions.
//
// The mare::assign_cost() API call allows the user to indicate the
// relative execution time of a node. A cost = 1.0 is assumed by
// default for all nodes. A user-specified cost of 'c' for node 'n'
// would indicate to MARE that 'n' has execution time 'c' times that
// of a node with cost 1.0.
//
// Please first see examples/sdfbasicpipe.cc for the basic mechanisms
// to construct a graph and execute it.
